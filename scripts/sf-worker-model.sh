# Project settings for Software Factory worker sessions on template computers.
# A template run starts in ~/.factory/software-factory/workstreams/<slug>, and
# hydration restores only memory/, scripts/ and skills/ there, so the project
# settings that beat the user defaults must be baked into the image. The
# ain3sh-dev template runs this as this repository's setup script; it takes
# effect on the next template build.
#
# sessionDefaultSettings pins workers to Fable 5.1. Cloud session sync comes
# from the user settings the template writes; the activity coordinator needs it
# to see a worker's session as alive.
